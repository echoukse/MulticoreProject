\begin{abstract}
    Queue delegation and Elimination are two techniques that help us improve the performance of shared data structures, by reducing contention. We use both these concepts together to implement a shared stack and analyse the performance we get from it. We have used the C++ libraries published by Klaftenegger~\cite{QDLibEuroPar-14}, and implemented elimination on top of it. We compare the performance of our implementation against the basic queue delegation, and MonitorT~\cite{hung2014activemonitor}.
